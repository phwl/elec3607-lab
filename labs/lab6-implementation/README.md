## Part 3 - ImplementationÂ  (this part will be moved to the next lab)

This part of the lab is optional and should be only be attempted if you
can finish the other two parts before the deadline. Using [these
toroid ferrite cores](https://au.element14.com/fair-rite/5961001101/ferrite-core-toroid-61/dp/1781375) and based on [this similar design](BPF-40m.pdf] (that design uses a different toroid core), build and test the BPF circuit
on the ELEC3608SDR board.
