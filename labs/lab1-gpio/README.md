# Lab1 gpio

In this lab you will learn how to manipulate GPIO output in two different
ways (libgpiod and mmap).

## 1. Installation (10%)
To start, you should download all the lab materials for this course. With your 
RPi connected to the internet, use the following command:
```bash
elec3607@raspberrypi:~ $ git clone https://github.com/phwl/elec3607-lab.git
Cloning into 'elec3607-lab'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 594, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (223/223), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (165/165), done.

Receiving objects: 100% (594/594), 53.54 MiB | 7.62 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (230/230), done.
```
This will create the directory ```elec3607-lab```. To go to the directory
for Lab 1:
```bash
elec3607@raspberrypi:~ $ cd elec3607-lab/labs/lab1-gpio/
elec3607@raspberrypi:~/elec3607-lab/labs/lab1-gpio $ ls
libgpiod_blink.c  Makefile  mmap_blink.c  README.md
```

Install the libgpiod library using the ```apt``` command. This needs
to be run as a superuser via ```sudo``` since the library is installed in 
a system directory (```/usr/lib/libgpiod.so```). This is done as below:

```bash
elec3607@raspberrypi:~/elec3607-lab/labs/lab1-gpio $ sudo apt install libgpiod-dev

## 2. Libgpiod (30%)

Since Linux v4.8, the standard way of using Linux GPIO has been viaÂ libgpiod. Prior to the introduction of libgpiod, the sysfs interface was used, but sysfs is depreciated and was removed from the mainline Linux kernel in 2020. The library
provides a hardware independent technique to perform input and output via GPIO (see [the manual](./libgpiod-ref.pdf)). 

The library comes with a number of command line tools to manipulate GPIOs:
```
gpiodetect - list all gpiochips present on the system, their names, labels and number of GPIO lines

gpioinfo - list all lines of specified gpiochips, their names, consumers, direction, active state and additional flags

gpioget - read values of specified GPIO lines

gpioset - set values of specified GPIO lines, potentially keep the lines exported and wait until timeout, user input or signal

gpiofind - find the gpiochip name and line offset given the line name

gpiomon - wait for events on GPIO lines, specify which events to watch, how many events to process before exiting or if the events should be reported to the console.
```

Here are some usage examples from the Linux documentation

The code in ```lab1-gpio/lab1-gpio/lab1/libgpiod_blink.c``` is a skeleton code. 
Complete the parts labelled ```XXX``` to create a program that will 
output a square wave on GPIO 26. Using an oscilloscope, measure the
frequency of the square wave and put a screen shot in your lab book
together with an explanation of the changes that you needed to make.

It is compiled and executed as follows:
```bash
elec3607@raspberrypi:~/elec3607-lab/labs/lab1-gpio $ make libgpiod_blink
cc -c -Wall -g   libgpiod_blink.c -o libgpiod_blink.o
cc -o libgpiod_blink libgpiod_blink.o -lgpiod 
elec3607@raspberrypi:~/elec3607-lab/labs/lab1-gpio $ ./libgpiod_blink
```

## 3. mmap (50 MHz) (40%)
Directly controlling the registers on the microcontroller via ```mmap(2)``` gives the highest performance and flexibility but is device-dependent. 

The code in ```mmap_blink.c``` is similar to ```libgpiod_blink.c``` except
that it directly manipulates registers. Again, there are parts missing to
the program marked as ```XXX```. Fill them in and create a version that
produces a square wave at 50MHz +/- 20%. Make an oscilloscope screen shot of this version and write an explanation of the changes that you needed to make.

## 4. mmap (highest speed) (30%)
Modify the mmap version to produce the highest clock frequency square wave,
capture a screen shot and record the shortest period achieved. Try to get the best oscilloscope trace of the
output. If it doesn't look like a square wave, explain why.
