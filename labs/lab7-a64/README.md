# A64 Assembly Language (Stack Frames and Function Calls)

## Introduction
The goals of this lab are:

    * Practise writing A64 assembly language
    * Learn to use the gdb debugger
    * Understand stack frames and function calls

ARM Linux will be used for this lab. Refer to [Learn the architecture - A64 Instruction Set Architecture Guide](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102374/0101) for information ob the A64 instruction set architecture. 

The following C program, printdec, prints the decimal value of 10 random numbers.

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void
printdec(int n)
{
    while (n > 0)
    {
        int c = n % 10;
        putchar(c + '0');
        n /= 10;
    }
    putchar('\n');
}

int
main()
{
    srand(0);
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
        int r = rand();

        printdec(r);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

The supplied copy of the program is split into 2 files, ```main.c``` and ```printdec.c```.
It can be compiled the commands below. Note how ```printdec.c``` is first compiled to ```printdec.s``` (using ```gcc -S printdec.c``` and then assembled to ```printdec.o``` (using as -o printdec.o printdec.s). For main.c, this is done in one step because we are not interested in the assembly language output.

```bash
$ make
gcc    -c -o main.o main.c
gcc -S  printdec.c
as -o printdec.o printdec.s
gcc -o printdec main.o printdec.o
```

It is executed as follows:
```bash
$ make
$ ./printdec

7772961861
5196364171

## Lab Questions

In your
answers, make sure that your assembly language code is clearly commented.

### Part 0 - Student Survey (additional 10%)

```

Using gdb ([manual here](https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb.html/index.html#Top)), also look at the TUI inteface section), put a breakpoint just before the call to printdec (```bl _printdec```) and display the value of the ```r``` variable. 
Single step the assembly language using gdb with the ```nexti``` command
and understand the operation of the program. Show the sequence of commands that you need in gdb to step ```_printdec``` and display the register values.

Note, the code that computes  ```n % 10``` and ```n / 10``` is really tricky. You don't need to annotate that in your answer (but can do so for extra credit in
Part 4).

Create an annotated version of ```printdec.s```. Put this in your lab book and make sure you explain the correspondence with each line of C. You can remove the .cfi and .loc directives in your answer as these are used to help the debugger relate the code back to the original C.

### Part 2 - Assembly Language version of printdec (40%)
When doing this exercise, it is unlikely your program will work first time so use the single step and register display facilities in gdb to debug your work. Note that you solution must be hand-written assembly language - we can tell the difference!

Note that _printdec uses the frame pointer for temporary variables. Rewrite in A64 assembly language using registers.

### Part 3 - Assembly Language version of printdec (30%)
From Part 2, you should have noticed that printdec() prints the string in the reverse order. Modify your assembly language program to fix this bug. Do this by buffering the data inside printdec() and then printing out the buffer in reverse.  
Hint: it might be easier to do it in C first, study the generated assembly code and then write your own version.

### Part 4 - Optional (20%)
This part gives you the opportunity to get bonus marks and very challenging. Annotate the
part that computes ```n % 10``` and ```n / 10``` giving a clear description of what it is doing.
